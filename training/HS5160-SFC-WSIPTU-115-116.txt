3.2 Sequence of Operation
Products are timed, & correctly spaced before place -
ment onto the downstream Product Infeed Conveyor by 
means of a Smooth  IPTU.
The Smooth  IPTU  consists of six separate conveyors, 
1-metering, 1-acceleration and 4-phasing.
From the  low back line pressure conveyor (recommend -
ed) the product passes onto the Metering conveyor.
This conveyor regulates (Meters) the flow products into 
the SIPTU and is running at a speed dependent on par -
ent machine speed and product length, and is calculated 
as follows:-
(Machine speed PPM x Product Length mm) ÷ 1000 = 
M/Min.
(Machine speed PPM x Product Length (in inches) ÷ 12 
=(feet). per minute.
From the Metering conveyor the product passes onto the 
Acceleration conveyor. This conveyor accelerates the 
products up to parent machine speed and pitches the 
product at the parent machine pitch length.
The speed is dependent on parent machine speed and 
pitch length, and is calculated as follows: -
(Machine speed PPM x Machine Pitch Length mm) ÷ 
1000 = M/Min.(Machine speed PPM x Product Length (in inches) ÷ 12 
=(feet) per minute.
From the Acceleration Conveyor the product is trans -
ferred onto first phasing conveyor, the leading edge is 
detected by a pair of product sensors.
A signal is sent to the PLC that product is detected, and 
the machine encoder position is then integrated. The tim -
ing Encoder is generally located on the outfeed end of 
the parent machine, but the Encoder MUST be mounted 
on a one to one shaft
The p osition of the flights on the Product Infeed Convey -
or, relative to the position of the product is then calculat -
ed. This is known as the CORRECTION FACTOR.
The Correction Factor is the distance a product has to 
be moved, in order to be finally placed in the correct po -
sition within the flights of the Product Infeed Conveyor. 
Each Phasing Conveyor’s correction factor is adjustable 
via the operator screen menu system.
The product has now passed over the first phasing con -
veyor and positioned to a percentage of the total correc -
tion factor.
As the product travels downstream over the phasing con -
veyors, each pair of sensors will signal the PLC to estab -
lish where the PRODUCT position is, relative to the po -
sition of the downstream conveyor flights. The remaining 
positional error of the product is established.28
8 17 2016Sectio n3Standard Machine Descriptio n
In order to place the product in the correct position, each 
conveyor has to move, (or phase) a certain distance. As 
the product passes along the phasing conveyors, each 
conveyor will apply an adjustment, (Correction Factor), 
as a percentage of the remaining positional error. 
Example Only:
Phasing Belt 1 = 0.40 (40%)
Phasing Belt 2 = 0.50 (50%)
Phasing Belt 3 = 0.90 (90%)
Phasing Belt 4 = 1.00 (100%)
If the positional error is 100mm:-
Phasing Belt 1 will apply a adjustment of 40% of 100mm = 
40mm, (60mm positional error remaining).
Phasing Belt 2 will apply a adjustment of 50% of 60mm = 
30mm, (30mm positional error remaining).
Phasing Belt 3 will apply a adjustment of 90% of 30 = 27mm, 
(3mm positional error remaining).
Phasing Belt 4 will remove the remaining product positional 
error if necessary.
The above example shows that phasing belt 1 is applying 
the most adjustment, and phasing belt 4 is applying the least 
adjustment.
On the final phasing conveyor the product is transferred 
into the flights of the downstream conveyor.3.2.1  INFORMATION
 Mode of Operation :
The metering belt meters the product into the SIPTU at the 
rate set by the product length in the machine setup screen 
1 and the speed of the closing machine as the SIPTU fol -
lows the closing machine. The product then transfers on
to the accelerating belts which pulls a gap between the 
products. The product gap is preset in the program and 
cannot be changed and the product then transfers onto 
phasing belt 1.
As the product triggers phasing belt 1 sensor, the prod -
uct speeds up over the correction distance set in machine 
setup and screen 1. This distance is the same for all the 
phasing belts. The speed is automatic and variable as the 
program deter mines how much the belt can speed up, by 
using the correction factor in the machine setup 2 screen. 
The product then transfers onto phasing belt 2 and the 
process starts all over again.     
Under normal operating conditions a queue is not expect -
ed to be present on the low back line pressure convey -
or.  The parent machine and the SIPTU normally run frac -
tionally faster than the upstream equipment is feeding the 
product, normally the Siptu and closing machine run 10% 
faster then production.
The Metering conveyor can accommodate a queue of 
product on the low back line pressure conveyor, should 
the feed rate momentarily exceed the speed of the parent 
machine and the SIPTU. The length of the queue will be 29

dependent on the type of low back line pressure convey -
or.  Too long a queue will cause product to be forced into 
the SIPTU at a rate greater than can be accommodated 
causing positional errors.

4.5.2 Lubrication 
Connect the piping for the automatic lubrication (where 
fitted) of theSIPTU. The SIPTU piping is normally an ex -
tension of the lubrication system.
4.5.3 Interconnections with parent machine
There are electrical connections with the parent machine
• Emergency stop circuit
• Running signal
• Encoder  connections
• PLC connections
Refer to the circuit diagrams in Section 8
There are two   types of encoder system.
If the parent machine is of the multiple servo-motor driv -
en type it will only be necessary to connect the signal 
wires as shown on the circuit drawing.
If the parent machine is of conventional  style and driven 
by one central motor, it will be necessary to fit the optical 
encoder supplied with  the SIPTU.
Proceed as follows :
1. At the parent machine, fit the IPTU-i timing encod -
er which must mounted on a 1:1 shaft. Refer to the 
parent machine Operating and Maintenance Man -
ual for further information.
2. Tighten the encoder collar retaining screws. 
3. Make the encoder electrical connections. Refer to 
the SIPTU electrical circuit diagrams.4 Follow the instructions given in Section 7 of this 
manual for setting up the timing of the encoder 
with reference to the SIPTU .
4.6 Pre-Production Operations and Checks
Check that the Emergency Stop button operates correct -
ly and stops both the IPTU and the main machine when 
operated.
At the appropriate time, ensure that the IPTU-i responds 
to the controls at the parent machine control panel in ad -
dition to the testing of the IPTU-i controls. When inching 
the parent machine, check for correct product deposition 
into the product infeed conveyor.37

5.8.1 TYPES OF STOPS
 
5.8.1 TYPES OF STOPS
There are two types of stops, Cycle Stops and Emergen -
cy Stops. 
• CYCLE STOP
A CYCLE STOP is the standard means of stopping the 
machine. Unless required for safety concerns (i.e. when 
a guard door is opened, or the machine faults), all stops 
are cycle stops.
The Cycle Stop button is locate on the HMI panel. To ini -
tiate the cycle stop procedure simply press this button. 
Once the button is pressed. the parent machine will deter -
mine the correct time to actually stop the machine. Give 
the Line a few seconds to clear the product so that it can 
stop in the correct location allowing for a jam free restart.51
8 17 2016Sectio n5Operator Contro ls
• EMERGENCY STOP
The Emergency Stop button is located on the HMI pan -
el next to the Start button, Reset Button and Cylce Stop 
button. Be sure to know the location of this E-Stop But -
ton.
Note!  When connected to the parent machine and in -
terfaced, all Cycle Stops and E-Stops on the parent ma -
chine will conduct their stopping features for the SIPTU 
machine as well.
E-STOP
Emergency Stop
Cycle Sto pAn Emergency Stop (E Stop) situation exists when any 
of the following occur.
    
1. An E-Stop push button is depressed.
2. A guard door is opened (Parent Machine).
3. A sensed jam.
4. A servo fault.
5. An improper reading of the photo-sensors.
An Emergency Stop will immediately stop all machine 
motion, dump pneumatic air, and the control screen will 
display that an Emergency Stop has been actuated.
5.8.2 OPERATIONAL STATE IDENTIFICATION
The control system has four main operational states: 
E-Stop, Homing, Ready, and Run. These are explained 
in detail below.
• E-STOP –  The machine is stopped, power is removed 
from components.
• HOMING –  The machine is moving each axis to its 
home position.
• READY – Power is on, the servos are in their home 
position, and other systems are powered and ready to 
run.
• RUN – The system is running
Each state is identified either by the color coded stack 
light located on the left side of the HMI screen, and/or 
on the message banner located at the top of the HMI 
screen. 52
8 17 2016Sectio n5Operator Contro ls
5.8.3 MACHINE STATE CHANGES
The system will enter an E-STOPPED STATE anytime 
a guard door is opened (On the Parent Machine), an 
E-Stop button is pressed, or a machine fault occurs. 
This is also the initial state after a power-up. Change out 
of this state requires that all guard doors to be closed, 
all E-Stop buttons be reset, and all machine faults be 
cleared.
From E-Stop the system will change to a Resetting 
State, whenever the Reset button on the Control Panel 
is pressed. Once the safety circuit has been checked the 
machine will enter the “Ready State”.

into the Operator Control Panel. Access to the various sub-
menu is achieved by simply pressing the required menu box 
on the screen. Adjustment to the settings is best acheived 
with the machine running at slow speed, with product.Before the machine can be adjusted the Sensors must 
be set to the correct positions. As shown in the diagram, 
X displays the product length once it is fully on the begin -
ning portion of the conveyor. Each Photo Sensor must be 
positioned so that it is in line with the leading edge of the 
product. Once the Sensor is positioned  (Each Phasing 
Belt Sensor must be positioned to the same dimension) 
the values can be then be adjusted. Review the following 
for a detailed description of each setting.
SIPTU OFFSET VALUE-  This is the required offset to 
achieve the proper timing of the product from the SIPTU 
onto the Parent machines Infeed Conveyor. 
PRODUCT LENGTH-  This is the length of the product, 
enter the length dimension here.
PHASING CORRECTION DISTANCE -  This value is 
based on the remaining distance once the product is on 
each phasing conveyor. As shown in the diagram A,B,C, 
and D is the determined Phasing Correction Distance. 
Once the Photo Sensor has been set measure the re -
maining distance and record that dimension here. This 
allows the SIPTU system to determine the maximum dis -
tance it has to correct the spacing for each product.56

6.7 BELT TENSIONING
1. Tension belt evenly on both sides of the con -
veyor by hand, to remove slack. Keep belt cen -
tered across the width of the conveyor. (Figure 
6.0)
2. Make (2) marks on top (flat) portion of the belt, 
EXACTLY 8.000” apart, at centerline and both 
edges of the Belt.
3. Gradually and Evenly Tension both sides (42)
(43) until distance between all (3) sets of marks 
are between 8.024” and 8.040”. 
4. Should Slippage ever occur, tensioned spac -
ing may be increased to 8.080” MAX.

6.8  BELT TRACKING 
1. Monitor belt path while the conveyor is running.
 
2. Shown  to the Right: (Figure 7.0)
If the belt runs towards the left on Downstream Idler, ini -
tially reduce tension on the right side slightly. 
Additional Tracking can be made by increasing Tension 
on the same side as the direction of track ( Left for Left, 
Right for Right ) 
3 Always verify proper tensioning during and following 
tracking process. If over tension occurs during tracking, 
it is best practice to review Tension on both sides and 
set to 8.024” – 8.040” and start tracking procedure over.

Installation and Setup Procedures 
 
Here we will discuss the proper procedures in  
installing and setting up the Photo Sensors for the 
SIPTU Machine. 
Default Settings:
The factory default settings are configured so that 
no teaching is required in most conditions. 
Output Mode:  
Dark Operate (Output ON when the light between the 
emitter and  the receiver is blocked)
Output Type: Auto PNP/NPN or IO-Link.  
In Auto PNP/NPN mode, the sensor continuously 
monitors the load connection and automatically 
configures the output to PNP or NPN.
Receiver User Interface   LED Status
The table below provides LED status on the receiver  
in the RUN mode i.e, during operation. The sensor is 
always in RUN mode, except when being taugh t.Auto PNP/NPN Operation

8 17 2016Setting up the Photo Sensors
Each Sensor must be set and positioned in the same 
location. Starting from the outfeed end follow the direc -
tions shown.
Measuring from the upstream idler centerline as shown 
determine the product length and measure downstream 
that distance. This will be the location to set the Photo -
Sensor centerline. Shown as „X“ on the diagram is that 
dimension.
Phasing Belt #4
“X”74
8 17 2016Sectio n6Maintenance
Align the Photo Sensors so that they are directly across 
from one another. The Center of the beam should be di -
rectly over the determined dimension of product length, 
inches position established earlier. Ensure that both 
Emitter and reciever are “seeing” one another.
Next you must train the eye without any product or de -
bris obstructing the view of the eye. 
Press and hold the button on top of the sensor for three 
(3) seconds until the Yellow LED light Starts Flashing. 
Release the button. The Sensor Has now been taught.
All remaining belts are to be guaged off of 
this first phasing belt. 
For each additional belt measure 10 inches 
from the previous 5.5 inch location. 
Posistion reletive to each belt should be the 
same 5.5 inches from downstream.

7.2 TIMING SENSOR SETUP
7.2.1 Phasing Conveyors Timing Sensors
Note: The following section  is a general guide to posi -
tioning the product sensors. This will vary depending on 
product type and the belt design. 
1. Measure the overall product length.
2. For closed flat belt conveyors, position the product 
over the first phasing belt so that the trailing edge is 
aligned with the end of the upstream conveyor.
3. With the product correctly positioned, move the tim -
ing sensors along the rails until they are just detect -
ing the front leading edge of the product - fix in posi -
tion.
4. Repeat the above procedure for the remaining 3 
phasing conveyors. Each sensor must be positioned 
in exactly the same position on each conveyor, and 
at equal pitch, (machine pitch = 9”, 12” or 15”).
Note!
The Sensor position must be set using the smallest prod -
uct.

SIPTU Offset Value – is the position of the product as 
it transfers onto the Infeed Conveyor of the parent ma -
chine. Note that the smaller the number the more ad -
vanced the product and the larger the number the more 
retarded the product relative to the PIC (product infeed 
conveyor).
Phasing Correction distance –  is the distance the servo 
belts move to change the product position. Normally the larg -
er the product the smaller the correction distance and the 
smaller the product the larger the correction distance.
Product Length (inches) –  is the measured length of the 
product  as the product approaches the SIPTU, simply mea -
sure the product length.

8 17 20167.3.2 Machine Options Page 3
This screen sets the percentage of correction for each 
servo belt so that any one belt is not trying to do all the 
correction but is shared between all four servo belts.
Normal setup is 
Belt 1 (upstream belt) is the 1st of 4 belts so belt 1 does 
25% (0.25) of the remaining correction.
Belt 2 is the 2nd of 3 remaining belts so belt 2 does 33% 
(3rd) (0.33) of the remaining correction.Belt 3 is the 3rd of 2 remaining belts so belt 3 does 50% 
(1/2) (0.50) of the remaining correction. 
Belt 4 is the 4th of 1 remaining belts so belt 4 does 100% 
(all) (1.0) of the remaining correction.     
If the product positional error is 100mm (4”) relative to the 
PIC pocket 
Phasing belt 1 will apply 25% of 100mm (4”) = 25mm (1”) 
of product movement which will leave 75mm (3”) position -
al error remaining.
Phasing belt 2 will apply 33% of 75mm (3”) = 25mm (1”) 
of product movement which will leave 50mm (2”) position -
al error remaining.
Phasing belt 3 will apply 50% of 50mm (2”) = 25mm (1”) 
of product movement which will leave 25mm (1”) position -
al error remaining.
Phasing belt 4 will apply 100% of 25mm (1”) = 25mm (1”) 
of product movement which will leave 0mm (0”) positional 
error remaining.
NOTE!!!! Any phasing belt correction factors chang -
es will only be registered in the CPU when the machine 
is stopped. To alter the factors first stop the SIPTU by 
pressing the normal stop button, access the machine set -
up screen 2 and adjust accordingly then press the start 
button.
