DO NOT underestimate the risks associated with using the machine and concentrate on the
work in progress.




                                 r
         Risks associated with using the Machine




                     e
Despite the implementation of all the safety devices for safe use of the machine, it is
necessary to take note of all the requirements for the prevention of accidents detailed in the




                   f
various sections of this manual.


         Protective equipment for the operator
Before starting any type of work, the operator must wear the appropriate personal protective
equipment (PPE) such as goggles, gloves etc. (see section 5.3 of this manual).

  1. Always check the efficiency and integrity of the machine.
  2. Before connecting the machine to the mains, make sure that the rotating parts are not
     damaged or badly worn. Make sure that the switch is in the neutral position.
  3. Do not start the machine in an enclosed or poorly ventilated area, or in the presence of
     a flammable and/or explosive atmosphere. Do not use the machine in damp and/or wet
     locations, or those exposed to rain.
  4. Avoid starting accidentally.
  5. Before starting the machine, get used to ensuring that no remaining maintenance and
     service keys are inserted.
  6. Keep the workplace tidy and free from obstruction; disorder causes accidents.
  7. Make sure that your work environment is forbidden to children, strangers and animals.



                                                                                     Page 7 of 84

                                                                           ACCESSORIES


  8. Do not perform tasks on the machine other than those for which it was designed. Only
      use the machine in the manner in which it was intended, as described in this
      instruction manual.
  9. Work without disturbances.
  10. Work areas must be well lit.
  11. Always wear eye protection and protective gloves while working. If dust is produced,
      use the appropriate masks.
  12. Wear appropriate clothing. Loose clothing, dangling jewellery, long hair, etc.., can get
      caught in the moving parts, causing irreparable injury.




                                                    m
  13. Firmly secure the workpiece before starting the lathe, using the jaws installed on the
      spindle.
  14. Always use the tool in an appropriate manner. Perform only the work for which the tool
      is made. Do not use the tool for inadequate work.




                                                  o
  15. Only use suitable resistance tools in relation to the work that is to be done. This is to
      avoid risky and unnecessary overloading for the operator, which may be harmful for
      the life of the tools themselves.




                                                 c
  16. Do not pick up moving tools or other moving parts. To stop the moving parts on the
      machine, always only use the stop command device.




                                              .i
  17. Before performing any measurement of the workpiece mounted on the spindle, turn the
      motor off, unplug it and wait for the spindle to stop.
  18. Do not remove the shavings with your hands, even at a standstill. To do this, use tongs
      or a palette knife.
  19. When the work tools need to be replaced or the speed needs to be changed, stop the




                                 v
      motor and wait for the spindle to stop.
  20. Do not move away from the machine until the tools and other moving parts, have




                               r
      completely stopped.
  21. After the work is completed, clean the tool and check its efficiency.
  22. Replace worn and/or damaged parts, check that the repairs and protections work




                   e
      properly before operating. Eventually, if necessary, have it checked by Service staff.
      Use only original spare parts.




                 f
  23. Unplug the power cord of the machine from the power outlet when:
       the machine is not being operated;
       it is left unattended;
       performing maintenance or registration, because the machine does not work properly;
       the power cable is damaged;
       the tool is replaced;
       it is being moved or transported;
       during cleaning operations.
  24. It is recommended that users of this publication, for maintenance and repair, have a
      basic knowledge of the mechanical principles and procedures inherent in repair
      technique.
  25. The company safety officer is required to make sure that machine operators
      have read and understood this manual in its entirety.
  26. Management is responsible for safety and verification of the company's risk
      status according to Legislative Decree 81/08.

2.2 Safety rules for electrical machine equipment

        Changes in the Electrical System
1. Do not modify the machine's electrical system in any way. Any attempt to do so may
   impair the operation of the electrical devices causing a malfunction or accident.
2. Work on the electrical system of the machine must therefore be carried out only by
   qualified and authorised personnel.
3. If you hear unusual noises, or notice anything unusual, stop the machine immediately.
   Then, carry out an inspection and, if necessary, perform any repairs as required.




                                                   m
  1. The supply voltage must correspond to that stated on the identification plate and in the
     technical specifications (400 V / 50 Hz or 230 V 50 Hz). Never use any other type of
     power supply.




                                                 o
  2. The use of a lifesaving device on the power supply line is recommended. For more
     detailed information, contact a trusted electrician.
  3. The power plug must be a grounded tripolar type plug for T999/400V and a grounded




                                                c
     bipolar plug for T999/230V. Any extension cords must be of equal or greater length
     than the power cord on the machine.




                                             .i
  4. Make sure that the power cord does not come into contact with hot objects, wet or oiled
     surfaces, and/or sharp edges.
  5. The power cord should be checked regularly and before each use to check for signs of
     damage or wear. If these are not in good condition, do not use the machine and replace




                                 v
     the cable.
  6. Do not use the power cord to remove the plug from the socket or move the machine.
