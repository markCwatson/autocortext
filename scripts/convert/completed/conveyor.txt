Maintaining the conveyor belts of the HS5160 machine from Kliklok-Woodman is crucial for ensuring efficient operation and longevity of the machine. This section provides a detailed guide on belt replacement, tensioning, and tracking procedures, designed to help maintenance personnel and operators manage and troubleshoot conveyor belt issues effectively.
Belt Replacement Procedure
Preparation:
Ensure the machine is powered off and locked out to prevent accidental startup.
Remove any guards or covers for access to the conveyor belts.
Steps:
Loosen the Motor Mounting Plate: This reduces tension on the belt, allowing for easier removal.
Remove the Timing Belt/Pulley: Detach the TL bushing that secures the pulley to facilitate belt removal.
De-tension the Belt: Use the jacking screws located on both sides of the conveyor to relieve tension.
Remove the Drive Pulley and Bearing: This provides clearance for the belt to be slid off the conveyor.
Slide Out the Old Belt: Carefully remove the belt from around the idlers and drive assembly.
Position the New Belt: Place the new belt around the idlers and through the drive assembly.
Reassemble the Drive Pulley and Bearing: Ensure they are securely fastened and aligned.
Re-tension the Belt: Adjust the jacking screws to apply the correct tension to the new belt.
Test for Proper Installation: Manually rotate the conveyor to ensure the belt moves smoothly without slipping or misalignment.
Belt Tensioning Procedure
Proper tensioning of the conveyor belt is essential for optimal performance and to prevent slippage or tracking issues.
Steps:
Measure Initial Belt Length: Mark two points on the belt at a known distance apart, typically 8 inches.
Apply Tension: Adjust the tensioning mechanism evenly on both sides of the conveyor to stretch the belt slightly.
Measure Stretched Length: Measure the distance between the two marks again; the belt should have stretched by a specific amount, indicating proper tension. The target stretched length should be within the manufacturer's specifications, usually around 8.024” to 8.040” for an 8-inch initial measurement.
Adjust as Necessary: If the belt has not stretched to the desired length, adjust the tensioning mechanism accordingly and re-measure.
Belt Tracking Procedure
Ensuring the belt tracks correctly on the conveyor is critical to prevent wear and ensure smooth operation.
Steps:
Start with Proper Tension: Before adjusting tracking, ensure the belt is correctly tensioned as per the above procedure.
Identify Tracking Issue: Run the conveyor and observe the path of the belt. If the belt drifts to one side, it needs adjustment.
Adjust Tension for Tracking: Slightly increase the tension on the side to which the belt is drifting. For example, if the belt drifts to the right, increase tension on the right side. This adjustment should be minor.
Re-observe and Adjust: Run the conveyor again to observe the belt's path. Continue to make small adjustments until the belt runs centrally along the entire length of the conveyor.
Check for Obstructions: Ensure there are no mechanical obstructions or misalignments causing the belt to track incorrectly.
Final Checks
After completing the belt replacement, tensioning, and tracking procedures, conduct a final check to ensure everything is correctly assembled, and the belt operates smoothly. Replace any guards or covers removed during the process, and perform a test run to verify that the conveyor operates as expected, paying close attention to the belt's movement and alignment.





Setting up and timing the HS5160 machine from Kliklok-Woodman involves precise adjustments to ensure optimal operation, accurate product handling, and synchronization with other machine components. This section outlines the steps and considerations for correctly setting up the machine and adjusting its timing for efficient production runs.
Initial Setup and Adjustments
1. Product and Machine Preparation
Ensure the machine is clean and all maintenance checks have been completed.
Select the appropriate product recipe on the HMI. This recipe includes specific settings for product dimensions, machine speed, and other operational parameters.
2. Conveyor Setup
Adjust conveyor belt tension and tracking as necessary (refer to the Belt Replacement, Tension, and Tracking section).
Verify that all conveyor belts are clean and free of debris to ensure smooth product transition.
3. Sensor Positioning
Position the product sensors along the conveyor to detect the product accurately. The sensors should be placed based on the product length, ensuring they trigger at the correct time as the product passes.
For phasing conveyors, ensure sensors are evenly spaced and aligned with the product's leading edge as it enters each conveyor section.
Timing Adjustments
1. Phasing Conveyor Timing
The goal is to ensure that products are correctly spaced and aligned as they move through the machine and onto the next process.
Adjust the timing of the phasing conveyors using the HMI. This involves setting the correction distance for each conveyor based on the product's length and the desired spacing between products.
2. Servo Motor Synchronization
Synchronize the servo motors controlling the conveyor belts to match the machine's overall speed and the specific requirements of the product being processed.
Use the HMI to adjust the servo motor speeds, ensuring smooth and consistent product flow.
3. Fine-Tuning Product Handling
After initial adjustments, run a test batch of products through the machine to observe the handling and spacing.
Make fine-tuning adjustments to the sensor positions, conveyor speeds, and phasing corrections as necessary to achieve optimal product handling.
Operational Checks and Validation
1. Test Runs
Conduct several test runs with actual products to validate the setup and timing adjustments.
Monitor the product flow through the machine, paying close attention to the transition points, product spacing, and alignment.
2. Verify Product Quality
Check the finished product for any issues related to the machine setup, such as misalignment or improper sealing (if applicable).
Adjust the machine settings as needed to correct any identified issues.
3. Continuous Monitoring
Once the machine is running smoothly, continue to monitor the operation closely, especially during the first few production runs after setup changes.
Be prepared to make minor adjustments as production continues and as different product batches may have slight variations.
Documentation and Record Keeping
Document all setup and timing adjustments made to the machine for future reference. This includes recording sensor positions, conveyor speed settings, and any specific changes made to accommodate the product being processed.
Keep a log of any issues encountered and the solutions implemented. This information can be invaluable for troubleshooting future setup changes or when switching between different products.
