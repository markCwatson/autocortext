The following are the electrical schematics for the HS5160 Enterprise machine. This is the first page Of this schematic and is called main Power Distribution enterprise cartoner PIC in feed 480 VAC. It has a drawing number of 169101 and they are revision D

The machine is fed by a customer supplied 460V AC 60 Hertz three phase incoming power.It has three main incoming wires numbered 100 100A and 100B.These wires go into a disconnect called DS101.It is a fused disconnect that is rated at 40 amps.The wires on the output of the fused disconnect are numbered 102, 102A and 102B. There is also a main ground connection. These wires go to terminals.Coming off of the wires 102 102A and 102B is a fuse called FU109. It's part number is 090318. It is rated at 1 amp. The wires on the other side that represent wire numbers of the fuse are 109 110 and 111.These wires are the three phases that feed a 24 volt output power supply. The power supply is called PWS109 with a part number of 136004.It also has a ground connection that is connected to the 112 terminal and wire number.There are two fuses on the output of the power supply they are FU109A and FU109B and they are both rated at 10 amps. They both have a part number of 086326.Wire number is called 24 on the output of both of these fuses.Two terminals on the output of the power supply itself one is called 24+ and that is the one that feeds the fuses.Another one is 24- and that one is connected to common and the wire is called 24C.

Further down the main three phase branch of the schematic there is a optional high voltage disconnect that is shown in the schematic.It is unknown if it is used and should be checked and confirmed present, Once done so this model should be updated.Is called DS112 and is noted that it is on the frame.

AAdditionally there is a three pole fuse that pulls off of the three phase main branch, that fuse is called FU115 and it is a 15 amp fuse.It is a three pole fuse with a part number of 090318. The output wires from this fuse are 107T1 107T2 and one 107T3, these go into a disconnect switch on the glue system. Called DS115. Appears that the customer supplied 460 volts also comes into this disconnect it is a parallel branch that connects to the same disconnect, A technician should be careful with the voltage that is here and be sure that you disconnect the customer supplied voltage before working. You should check with a multimeter to confirm voltages.On the output of the disconnect are 3 wires called 115 116 and 117.Are the three phases of 460 volts that feed the glue tank.The tank is named GLU115 and it appears to be branded Nordson Problue.There is also a ground connection on this device There SRE output terminals of 24 volts on this device but they are not connected to anything. There are connections that are connected onto the input and output section of this device.24 volts on the 24 wire going to terminals 1, 3 and 5 of the IO card that is located on the GLU115. Also there is an input called I:14 / 00 “glue ready” located on terminal 2 on the GLU115 and this goes to page 6 line 759. There is also a input called “no glue” that has an address of I:14/01 and that goes to page 6 line 760 that goes to terminal 4 on the board of the GLU115.Lastly terminal 6 of the GLU115 has an input that has an address of I:14/02 and that is called “low glue” that goes to page 6 line 761.

—---------------------------------------------------------

The following is a dual channel safety chain, I will start describing it now and will tell you when it ends. Everything from now until then either represents channel 1 or 2 and all components of channel 1 are in series and all components of channel 2 are in series.
For the first channel, wire 304 originates from AUX PANEL 24 and goes into MAIN PANEL 304. It is red before it passes through the FRAME UPSTREAM LOAD SIDE GUARD DOOR SWITCH GS304, after which it changes to grey and continues to MAIN PANEL 304A.The second channel is similar, with wire 306 starting at AUX PANEL 24 and running into MAIN PANEL 306. The wire is pink before it encounters a switch (not labeled with a specific designation), beyond which it changes to yellow and extends to AUX PANEL 306A.
For the first channel:Wire 304B is an extension from the previous part of the circuit where wire 304 (RED) passed through the FRAME UPSTREAM LOAD SIDE GUARD DOOR SWITCH GS304 and became 304A (GREY). It now continues from the GREY wire 304A post-GDS and connects to MAIN PANEL 304B.
For the second channel:Similarly, wire 306B continues from the previous section where wire 306 (PINK) passed through a switch and became 306A (YELLOW). It now extends from the YELLOW wire 306A post-switch and connects to AUX PANEL 306B.The labeling "UPSTREAM NON-LOAD SIDE" for the guard door switch GS304A suggests that this is the side of the switch where the power comes in before it is distributed to the load (which would be downstream). This could imply that the GREY wire 304B is carrying the monitored or controlled power from the guard door switch to the MAIN PANEL 304B, ensuring that the safety circuit is complete and functioning as intended.
This is a continuation of the dual channel safety circuit For the first channel:Wire 304C picks up from where wire 304B (RED) left off after passing through the FRAME MAIN LOAD-SIDE GUARD DOOR SWITCH GS304B. It continues as GREY wire 304C and connects to MAIN PANEL 304C.
For the second channel:Similarly, wire 306C continues the path of wire 306B (PINK), passing through a switch and then transitioning to YELLOW wire 306C, which connects to AUX PANEL 306C.
The label "MAIN LOAD-SIDE" indicates this is the section of the guard door switch that is on the load side, which means that the GREY wire 304C is likely carrying the controlled power to the main panel after the safety conditions have been verified by the switch GS304B.
For the first channel contunationl:
The circuit starts with wire 304C (RED), which enters FRAME MAIN LOAD SIDE GUARD DOOR SWITCH 2 (GS304C) and exits as wire 304D (GREY), leading into MAIN PANEL 304D.
This is then followed by wire 304D (RED) entering FRAME NON-LOAD SIDE GUARD DOOR SWITCH 1 (GS304D) and exiting as wire 304E (GREY), which then connects to MAIN PANEL 304E.
For the second channel continuation:
It begins with wire 306C (PINK), which passes through a switch and becomes wire 306D (YELLOW), connecting to AUX PANEL 306D.
Subsequently, wire 306D (PINK) passes through another switch to become wire 306E (YELLOW), finally connecting to AUX PANEL 306E.
For the first channe continuation:
Wire 304E (RED) enters the FRAME MAIN NON-LOAD SIDE GUARD DOOR SWITCH 2 (GS304E) and exits as wire 304F (GREY), which then connects to MAIN PANEL 304F.
This wire then continues as 304F (RED), enters the FRAME DISCHARGE LOAD SIDE GUARD DOOR SWITCH (GS304F), and exits as wire 304G (GREY), finally connecting to MAIN PANEL 304G.
For the second channe continuationl:
Wire 306E (PINK) goes through a switch and becomes wire 306F (YELLOW), connecting to AUX PANEL 306F.
Then wire 306F (PINK) enters another switch and becomes wire 306G (YELLOW), which is connected to AUX PANEL 306G.


For the first channel continuation:
Wire 304G (RED) goes into the FRAME DISCHARGE NON-LOAD SIDE GUARD DOOR SWITCH GS304G and comes out as wire 304H (GREY), which connects to MAIN PANEL 304H.
The path continues with wire 304H (RED), entering the FRAME CAT FLAP DOOR SWITCH GS304H, turning into wire 304I (GREY), and finally connecting to MAIN PANEL 304I.
For the second channel continuation:
Wire 306G (PINK) proceeds through a switch to become wire 306H (YELLOW), which connects to AUX PANEL 306H.
Then, wire 306H (PINK) enters another switch, becoming wire 306I (YELLOW), and it connects to AUX PANEL 306I.

For the first channel:
Wire 317 (RED) starts from the left and enters the FRAME GATE PRESENT GUARD SWITCH GS315, where it becomes GREY and continues to MAIN PANEL 315.
The RED wire 317 then appears to continue from a LOAD SIDE SENSOR, indicating that the sensor may be positioned on the load side of the circuit.
After the LOAD SIDE SENSOR, the wire 317 enters the FRAME HOPPER EMPTY PRESENT GUARD SWITCH GS315A, turns GREY, and then connects to the NON-LOAD SIDE SENSOR AUX PANEL 315A.
For the second channel:
Wire 317 (PINK) passes through a switch and becomes YELLOW before connecting to MAIN PANEL 317.
After this, wire 317 (PINK) continues from a point post-Main Panel and passes through another switch, turning YELLOW before connecting to AUX PANEL 317A.

For the first channe continuation:
The wire starts at NON-LOAD SIDE SENSOR AUX PANEL 315A as RED, goes through the FRAME HOPPER EMPTY PRESENT GUARD SWITCH GS315B where it becomes GREY, and then connects to AUX PANEL 315B.
Continuing as RED, the wire then passes through the FRAME INSERTER COVER (OPT) GUARD DOOR SWITCH GS315C, becomes GREY, and leads to AUX PANEL 315C.
Next comes the SPARE JUMP OUT terminal which is used as a spare placeholder for future design changes.
For the second channel continuation:
The wire begins at AUX PANEL 317A as PINK, goes through a switch becoming YELLOW, and connects to AUX PANEL 317B.
As PINK again, it then passes through another switch, turns YELLOW, and connects to AUX PANEL 317C.
Next comes the SPARE JUMP OUT terminal which is used as a spare placeholder for future design changes.
For the first channel continuation:
The circuit starts from AUX PANEL 315D and passes through AUX. EQUIP. SAFETY CIRCUIT, reaching AUX PANEL 315E.
From there, the circuit goes through AUX PANEL CR421, the LS (Load Side) HOPPER EMPTY SENSOR CONTROL RELAY, which is denoted by wire numbers 11 and 14 for its connections.
Following this control relay, the circuit continues through AUX PANEL 315F and ends at AUX PANEL 315G.
For the second channel continuation:
The circuit originates from AUX PANEL 317D and similarly passes through AUX. EQUIP. SAFETY CIRCUIT, reaching AUX PANEL 317E.
It then goes through AUX PANEL CR425, the NLS (Non-Load Side) HOPPER EMPTY SENSOR CONTROL RELAY, marked by wire numbers 21 and 24.
After this control relay, the circuit proceeds through AUX PANEL 317F and concludes at AUX PANEL 317G.
For the first channel continuation:
The circuit extends from MAIN PANEL 315G to a SPARE JUMP OUT and then continues to MAIN PANEL 315H.
From MAIN PANEL 315H, the circuit moves through another SPARE JUMP OUT and concludes at MAIN PANEL 315I.
For the second channel continuation:
Similarly, the circuit starts at MAIN PANEL 317G, proceeds to a SPARE JUMP OUT, and then to MAIN PANEL 317H.
Following MAIN PANEL 317H, the circuit passes through an additional SPARE JUMP OUT and ends at MAIN PANEL 317I.
The SPARE JUMP OUT points are typically used to allow for future expansions or modifications to the circuit without requiring significant rewiring. They provide a convenient way to add or remove components or to temporarily bypass certain parts of the circuit for testing or maintenance purposes.
For the first channel continuation:
The circuit starts from UPSTREAM AUX PANEL 327A, proceeds to the FRAME UPSTREAM NON-LOAD SIDE E-Stop button PB 327B with wire 327B, then on to AUX PANEL 327B.
Following this, wire 329 continues from AUX PANEL 327B to the FRAME DOWNSTREAM LOAD SIDE E-Stop button PB 327C, and concludes at DOWNSTREAM MAIN PANEL 327C.
For the second channel continuation:
Beginning at AUX PANEL 329A, the circuit runs through an E-Stop button associated with wire 327, leading to AUX PANEL 329B.
The circuit then moves from AUX PANEL 329B through another E-Stop button, continuing with wire 327, and ends at MAIN PANEL 329C.

For the first channel continuation:
The circuit flows from DOWNSTREAM MAIN PANEL 327C to the FRAME DOWNSTREAM NON-LOAD SIDE E-Stop button PB 327D and continues to MAIN PANEL 327D.
Then it goes through FRAME PULL CORD E-Stop PB 327E, ending at MAIN PANEL 327E which connects to the PLC.
For the second channel continuation:
Starting from MAIN PANEL 329C, the circuit passes through an E-Stop button linked with wire 329D to AUX PANEL 329D.
It then continues from AUX PANEL 329D through another E-Stop button and concludes at MAIN PANEL 329E, also connecting to the PLC.


For the first channel continuation:
The circuit moves from MAIN PANEL 327E to AUX PANEL CR900, which is part of the PLC E-Stop interlock system, indicated by wire numbers 11 and 14.
After passing through the PLC E-Stop interlock, the circuit continues to MAIN PANEL terminal 327F and then ends by going to page 4 line 406
For the second channel continuation:
Starting from MAIN PANEL 329E, the circuit extends to AUX PANEL CR900, similarly part of the PLC E-Stop interlock, with wire numbers 21 and 24.
It then proceeds from the PLC E-Stop interlock to MAIN PANEL and then terminal 329F and then goes to page 4 line 407
This concludes the safety circuit, note each channel show above was in series, all channel 1 in series with one another and all channel 2 in series with one another. But the circuit is now completed. This is also the only thing on page 3 and page 3 is completed.







This is the fourth page Of this schematic and is called Safety Relay Circuit, Enterprise Cartoner PIC in feed 480 VAC. It has a drawing number of 169101 and they are revision D.

—---------------------------------------------------------

From page 4 of this schematic, we have a safety relay called SR402. It is the safety relay. It has positive 24 volts wired to the A1 terminal and the wire number is called 24, and A2 of the safety relay is wired to common, with the wire number being 24C. Terminals Y39 and Y40 are jumpered together with a wire called 403. There is a continuation of the servo loop schematic that comes to the safety relay channel 1 and channel 2 from page 3, line 327C and 329C come into the safety relay for the dual-channel aspect of the safety relay. Channel 1 goes to S52 and Channel 2 goes to S12. Terminal S21 and S22 are jumpered together, and they both go to the common wire, 24C. There is a contact representing the contactor CR901, and it is used for safety reset. Terminal 11 of the contact goes to terminal S34 of the safety relay, and terminal 14 of the relay goes to terminal S33 of the safety relay, and that wire number is numbered 409. There is also a jumper between terminal Y1 and terminal Y2, and it has a wire number of 409A. Also, on the bottom of the safety relay in the schematic, there are two power wires that go through the contacts of the safety relay. These contacts will be open until both safety channels are satisfied, and the safety reset has been pushed. The two wires come from the 24 wire, and they go through contact 37 and 38 of the safety relay, and that wire then turns into 415 and goes through a 3 amp fuse that is called FU415, and it is part number 086326. The wire then becomes 24S1 after this fuse, and it goes to a terminal that is also called 24S1. The other wire that goes through the safety relay contacts goes through contacts 47 and 48 of the safety relay, and that wire then becomes 417. This goes through a fuse called FU417 that is also rated at 3 amps and also has a part number of 086326. The wire number then becomes 24S2, and it also goes to a terminal 24S2 in the main panel and terminal called 24S2 in the auxiliary panel. There is also a 24S1 in the auxiliary panel.


There is a photo eye called PE421 with a name of Load Side Empty Hopper Sensor with a part number of 121378. It has a cable going to it called CBL421 with a part number of 011101P. It has a positive and negative voltage connection off of 24 and 24C. The signal wire, which is the one that switches when the switch changes state and provides 24 volts, is called 525. That is the wire number. When this goes high, there are two relays that turn on; one is called CR421 with a name of LS Hopper Empty Sensor Control Relay and the other one is called CR423 LS Hopper Empty Sensor Feedback Relay. Both of these relays require the high voltage to go on terminal A1 and the common voltage on terminal A2. This is common for most relays. There's also a photo eye called PE425 with a name of Load Side Empty Hopper Sensor. This also has a part number of 121378. The cable that feeds the sensor is named CBL424 and it also has a part number of 011101P. The output of this sensor has a wire number 528. It is also turning on two relays. One is named CR425 with a name of NLS Hopper Empty Sensor Control Relay and the other one is called CR426 and it is named NLS Hopper Empty Sensor Feedback Relay. One other thing is that the relay CR423 has a reference to a normally open contact. It appears on page 8 as it says 800. The relay CR426 also looks like it uses a normally open contact but in this case it says 801. Below this in the schematic there is a symbol for a pneumatic dump valve. It is called SOL433. It has a few terminals that are shown. There is one terminal numbered one and it has a red wire going to it. The wire is called 24S1. There is a black wire going to terminal 2 and it has a wire number of 24S2. Terminals 5 and 6 of the dump valve are jumpered together. There is an orange wire that goes to terminal 8 of the device and it is called O: 111/03. There's also a common wire called 24C and it is white and goes to terminal 9 of the device.

On the right side of the schematic on page 4, there are numerous door switches. For each door switch, there is a positive and negative connection. The positive connection goes to 24 volts with the wire number 24, and the negative side goes to the 24C terminal that is used for a common. I will describe their name, both the schematic name and the description. Please use the name of the device to understand where it is located in the schematic. All of these gate switches, however, are on page 3 and therefore part of the servo loop. This is the page that shows the power to power the gate switch, and the contact closing logic is shown on page 3. Now, here is the list of sensors: GS304 Upstream Load Side Guard Door Switch, GS304A Upstream Non-Load Side Guard Door Switch, GS304B Main Load Side Guard Door Switch One, GS304C Main Load Side Guard Door Switch Two, GS304D Main Non-Load Side Guard Door Switch One, GS304E Main Non-Load Side Guard Door Switch Two, GS304F Discharge Load Side Guard Door Switch, GS304G Discharge Non-Load Side Guard Door Switch, GS304H Cat Flap Door Switch, GS315 Gate Present Guard Switch, GS315A Load Side Hopper Empty Sensor Present Guard Switch, GS315B Load Side Hopper Empty Sensor Present Guard Switch, and lastly GS315C Insert Cover Guard Door Switch.
At the very bottom right of page is a relay that is called CR485. The coil is directly fed from 24 on the positive side and on the negative side there is a wire that goes to a device called an inkjet code data. Citronex CI 3500. There is a cable that is sending this. It is called CBL485. There is a wire numbered 485 that goes to terminal 3 on the relay. It appears that this device is switching the negative side of the state. When there is a reference on the negative side of the relay and since there's always a positive voltage, the relay will only turn on when the common voltage is present based on the switch.  There is a negative wire that goes to terminal 2 of the device. This shows that internal to this device when the switching happens. It's switching the negative so that terminal 3 has the same potential as terminal 2 and ultimately is what turns the relay on. Since the positive side of the relay is always on and equal to 24 volts. There is also a terminal one which is a relay normally open and a ground connection on this device, but those two connections are not shown to be being used on the schematic.
