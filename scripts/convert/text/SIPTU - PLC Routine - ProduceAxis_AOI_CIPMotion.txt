This provides the .l5k program export overview of ProduceAxis_AOI_CIPMotion routine within the PLC from the HS5160 machine from Kliklok-Woodman, a Enterprise Endload Cartoner. Use this program to understand the logic so that it can be queried in the future. What will often be asked is information about why a program may not be working, so this document provides the information necessary to answer this.
